I have successfully integrated the new vehicle tracking system into your React frontend at http://localhost:5174/

## 🔄 Changes Made

### 1. Production Dashboard (`/production-dashboard`)
- **Updated "Vehicle Tracking" button** → Now opens the web map in a new tab
- **Button now shows**: 🗺️ Vehicle Map (opens `http://localhost:5001/vehicle-location-map.html`)
- **Added Vehicle Tracking card** → Quick action to access full vehicle tracking page
- **Improved layout** → Cards now display in 4-column grid to accommodate new feature

### 2. Vehicle Tracking Page (`/vehicle-tracking`)
- **Completely redesigned** with modern interface
- **Integrated map component** → Shows real-time GPS data from our new API
- **Added quick access buttons** for:
  - 📱 **Driver GPS tracking** (mobile-friendly pages)
  - 🖥️ **Manager map viewing** (web-based monitoring)
  - Both **local** and **external** (ngrok) versions available

### 3. VehicleMap Component
- **Updated API endpoint** → Now connects to `/api/vehicle-location` (our new system)
- **Enhanced UI** → Modern dashboard with status indicators, GPS coordinates, timestamps
- **Real-time updates** → Auto-refreshes every 10 seconds
