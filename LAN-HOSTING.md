# LAN Hosting Configuration

This project now supports LAN (Local Area Network) hosting, allowing you to access the application from other devices on the same network (phones, tablets, other computers).

## Why Use Network Access?

- Test the system on real mobile devices
- Multiple people can access the system simultaneously 
- Field supervisors can use tablets in the plantation
- Production managers can track vehicles on mobile phones

## üåê Network Access

### Quick Network Info
Run this command from the project root to see all available network URLs:
```bash
node network-info.js
```

## Setup Steps

1. **Start the servers**
```bash
# Backend server
cd BACKEND
npm run dev

# Frontend server (new terminal)
cd FRONTEND  
npm run dev
```

2. **Get your network IP address**
```bash
node network-info.js
```

3. **Access from other devices**
- Connect phone/tablet to same WiFi network
- Open browser and go to the network URL
- Example: `http://192.168.1.100:5173`

## Quick Setup (Windows)

Double-click `setup-lan.bat` to see your network URLs automatically.
### Frontend Access URLs
- **Local**: http://localhost:5173
- **Network**: http://[YOUR-IP]:5173 (shown in network-info.js output)

### Backend Access URLs  
- **Local**: http://localhost:5001
- **Network**: http://[YOUR-IP]:5001 (shown in network-info.js output)

## Troubleshooting

**Can't access from phone?**
- Check if Windows Firewall is blocking ports 5173 and 5001
- Make sure phone is on same WiFi network
- Try different network IP shown in network-info.js

**Port already in use?**
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F
```

## Technical Details

The system is configured to:
- Accept connections from any device on local network
- Automatically detect correct API endpoints
- Work with common network configurations (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)

### Frontend (Vite) Configuration
```javascript
// vite.config.js
server: {
  host: true, // bind to all interfaces (LAN)
  port: 5173,
  strictPort: true, // fail if port is taken
}
```

### Backend (Express) Configuration
```javascript
// server.js
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  // Displays network URLs on startup
});

// CORS configured for LAN access
const corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    // Allows localhost and local network IPs
    // Patterns: 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x
  }
};
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- **Firewall**: Windows may block the ports - allow if prompted
- **Network Only**: Only accessible within your local network
- **Development Mode**: This is for development, not production

## üì± Mobile Access

Perfect for testing on mobile devices:
1. Connect phone/tablet to same WiFi
2. Open browser and go to network URL
3. Full responsive interface available

## üîß Database & API Network Fix ‚úÖ

**MAJOR UPDATE**: All database and API functionality now works perfectly on network devices!

### The Problem (Now Fixed):
- ‚ùå Frontend was accessible: `http://172.20.10.10:5173`  
- ‚ùå But API calls were hardcoded to: `localhost:5001`
- ‚ùå Result: UI loaded but database operations failed on network devices

### The Solution Applied:
‚úÖ **Smart API Detection**: Automatically uses correct IP based on access method
‚úÖ **Dynamic Configuration**: No manual setup required
‚úÖ **Universal Compatibility**: Works on localhost and network simultaneously

### Technical Implementation:
```javascript
// FRONTEND/src/config/api.js - Auto-detects correct API endpoint
function getApiBaseUrl() {
  const { protocol, hostname } = window.location;
  
  // Localhost access ‚Üí use localhost:5001
  if (hostname === 'localhost' || hostname === '127.0.0.1') {
    return 'http://localhost:5001';
  }
  
  // Network access ‚Üí use same IP (e.g., 172.20.10.10:5001)
  return `${protocol}//${hostname}:5001`;
}
```

### Files Updated:
‚úÖ Inventory Management (Tools, FNI items)
‚úÖ Authentication system
‚úÖ Vehicle tracking GPS
‚úÖ Report generation  
‚úÖ All database operations

### Test Your Configuration:
Access: `http://[YOUR-IP]:5173/api-test.html` from any device to verify API connectivity.

## üì± Now Fully Mobile-Ready

Perfect for Tea Estate operations:
- **‚úÖ Field Supervisors**: Manage workers on tablets
- **‚úÖ Vehicle Drivers**: GPS tracking on mobile phones  
- **‚úÖ Inventory Staff**: Stock management with mobile scanning
- **‚úÖ Production Managers**: Real-time reports on any device

**Status**: üéâ **Complete Success** - Full functionality across all network devices!

This setup is perfect for testing mobile responsiveness and multi-user scenarios during development.
